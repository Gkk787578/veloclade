# Veloclade

**Veloclade** (Velocity + Clade) is an experimental neuro-symbolic knowledge graph system.

It uses dynamic clade-inspired structures combined with dense embedding clustering (sentence-transformers) to control hierarchy growth and reduce subclassing explosion.

Tardigrade mascot = extreme resilience under data scaling.

## 📋 Project Description

Veloclade is a prototype of a neuro-symbolic knowledge graph system designed for experimentation in:
- Controlled automatic ontology growth
- Hybrid symbolic + dense vector reasoning
- Self-organizing knowledge structures

**Current status:** early-stage prototype research code.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- sentence-transformers
- numpy
- scikit-learn

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Run Example

```bash
python veloclade.py
```

## 🛣️ Research Roadmap

1. Fine-tuning dynamic clade growth
2. Soft symbolic-embedding bridges
3. Dynamic fuzzy reasoning
4. Multi-context heterarchical modeling
5. Provenance tracking
6. Scalability experiments
7. Visualization tools
8. Research publication

👉 Contributions and collaboration welcome!
