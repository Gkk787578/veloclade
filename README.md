## Introduction

Veloclade integrates a clade-inspired hierarchy with embedding clustering techniques to create a robust knowledge graph system. It aims to control ontology growth and mitigate subclassing explosion, making it an ideal platform for experimentation in hybrid reasoning and AI knowledge representation.

The combination of symbolic and neural approaches allows for more resilient AI systems. Veloclade's architecture is flexible, making it suitable for various research applications.

## Features

- **Clade-Inspired Hierarchy**: Organizes knowledge in a way that reflects biological classification, promoting efficient information retrieval.
- **Embedding Clustering**: Utilizes sentence-transformers to group similar concepts, enhancing the system's ability to understand and represent knowledge.
- **Dynamic Ontology Management**: Adjusts the ontology in real-time to accommodate new information without overwhelming the system.
- **Neuro-Symbolic Integration**: Merges the strengths of symbolic reasoning with neural networks for better decision-making capabilities.
- **Research Prototype**: Designed for academic and industrial researchers looking to explore advanced AI concepts.
